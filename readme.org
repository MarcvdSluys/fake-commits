#+title: fake-commits

This script creates fake commits.  It can be used to e.g. confuse GitHub's Contribution Calendar, which is a
privacy issue and cannot be switched off ([[https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/142][1]], [[https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/4098][2]]) or just impress your (rather naive) employer with your 10.000
commits a day.
